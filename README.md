## Goal Behind

The goal in this project was to put to practice everything that have been seen in previous lectures. From AutoLayout to IBOutlets, IBActions and Segue.

## General Info

This app helps its user with the difficult part of splitting a bill. The user enters the amount to split, the tip if any is necessary and the number of 
people in between which the final bill is going to be split.
